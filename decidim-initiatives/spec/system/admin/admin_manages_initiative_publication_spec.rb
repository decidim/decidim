  # We cannot use the shared example "manage participatory space publications"
  # as Initiatives have some differences in comparison with the other spaces:
  #
  # - Initiatives are not published/unpublished, they are validated
  # - There is a modal to confirm the publish/unpublish
  # - The public collection path is still visible even though there are not initiatives
  # - The initiative is visible for administrators even when it is unpublished
  #
  # That is why I copied and adapted that shared example to this file.
