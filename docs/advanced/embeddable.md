# Embeddable

`Decidim` allows you to share a information box related to some spaces as:

- **Assemblies**
- **Conferences**
- **Initiatives**
- **Participatory processes**

or even `Meetings` component in an easy way with the `embeddable` option that offers the platform.

## How to

All that you have to do, is to enter into whathever space/component you want to share info to, and look for down right part of the page to find embeddable share option.

If it's embeddable, you'll see `embed <\>` option there.

Then you can click there, and following that, a new window will pop up showing you the necessary code to embed that space's info into where you want through the html given code in form of a card view.

That's all!
