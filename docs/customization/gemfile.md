# Gemfile

You can add and change your Gemfile as you want, this is a classic Ruby on Rails application. For example to add [rails-footnotes](https://github.com/josevalim/rails-footnotes) gem you would just add:

```ruby
gem 'rails-footnotes', '~> 4.0'
```

And then just do the classic Ruby on Rails flow bundle install and following any gem specific install steps from its own documentation.
