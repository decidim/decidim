# CSS Styles with SASS

One of the first things youâ€™ll want to do after you install Decidim is applying your own corporative image. To do this, you can go to app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.sass on your generated application with your own colors. There you can override any class using CSS with SASS.

In [decidim-core/app/assets/stylesheets/decidim/_variables.scss](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/master/decidim-core/app/assets/stylesheets/decidim/_variables.scss) you can find the `variables` that can be overriden in your `sass`.

We use [SASS, with SCSS syntax](http://sass-lang.com/guide) as CSS preprocessor.

## **Accesibility**

To maintain accesibility level, if you add new colors use a [Color contrast checker](http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) (WCAG AA is mandatory, WCAG AAA is recommended)
