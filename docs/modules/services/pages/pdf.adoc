= PDF signature service

Used by `decidim-initiatives` and `decidim-budgets`.

Provide a class to process a pdf and return the document including a digital signature. The instances of this class are initialized with a hash containing the :pdf key with the pdf file content as value. The instances respond to a signed_pdf method containing the pdf with the signature.

An example class would be something like:

[source,ruby]
....
class MyPDFSignatureService
  attr_accessor :pdf

  def initialize(args = {})
    @pdf = args.fetch(:pdf)
  end

  def signed_pdf
    # Code to return the pdf signed
  end
end
....

The arguments provided for the initialize method are:

- `pdf` - The document that needs to be signed

Then you will need to configure it with the help of Environment Variables:

[source,bash]
....
export DECIDIM_PDF_SIGNATURE_SERVICE="PdfSignatureExample"
....
