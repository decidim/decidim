= Configuring

Decidim is a Ruby on Rails library, and as such we try to follow their conventions. Please read https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html[Configuring Rails Applications]. 

Just as a reminder, these files are important: 

* config/database.yml
* config/secrets.yml

We also have the file `config/initializer/decidim.rb` where you can change the behaviour defined on the diferent components (most notably from `decidim-core`).

== Environment Variables 

We try to let most of the things defined through Environment Variables, as https://12factor.net/config[12factor applications's config]. You'll need to configure through your hosting provider (for example in Heroku), through a gem like `figaro` or through docker-compose `env_file`.
