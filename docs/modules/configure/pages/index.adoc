= Configuring

Decidim is a Ruby on Rails library, and as such we try to follow their conventions. Please read https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html[Configuring Rails Applications]. 

Just as a reminder, these files are important: 

* config/database.yml
* config/secrets.yml

Although most of these settings you can change them through xref:configure:environment_variables.adoc[Environment Variables].

You also have more settings in:

* xref:configure:initializer.adoc[Decidim initializer file].
* System panel.
