= Environment Variables

We try to let most of the things defined through Environment Variables, as https://12factor.net/config[12factor applications's config]. You will need to configure through your hosting provider (for example in Heroku), through a gem like `figaro` or through docker-compose `env_file`.

This is an extensive list of all the Env variables supported for an application created with the default `decidim` generator (ie: `decidim my-application`). Custom applications may modify or customize the default decidim initializer (`config/initializers/decidim.rb`) in such a a way that this will have no effect.

Finally, take into account that there are some config variables not available as Env vars, this is because it is not enough to set them in order to make that particular feature to work, it requires the user to add some custom code (usually a service class that acts a wrapper for an external API). These are the case for initializers such as `sms_gateway_service`, `timestamp_service`, `pdf_signature_service` or `machine_translation_service`. For more information about these extra services check the xref:configure:initializer.adoc[Initializer documentation].

The next tables show all the default Env Vars available when running a default Decidim application (note that customized Decidim apps might differ). The ones marked in *bold* are the minimal required to run a production server. The ones marked as _italic_ are only required for development.

|
|No

|*RAILS_ENV*

|QUEUE_ADAPTER
|Use this var to establish the https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html#backends[backend used to process jobs] in your application.

*Note that every backend requires some additional configuration steps.*

*Also take into account that the default value (async) is not suitable for production environments*

Common values are `sidekiq` and `delayed_job`.

If you decide to use `sidekiq`, you can easily generate the additional required files with the `--queue` option in the `decidim` generator (delayed_job is not supported yet, but you can easily follow the official instructions).

- Check the https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job[Delayed Job info]
- Check the https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki[Sidekiq info]

|No

|SIDEKIQ_CONCURRENCY
|If you are using `sidekiq` as your job processor backend. You can use this var to tune the number of concurrent sidekiq processes running in parallel (this only applies if you are using the default `config/sidekiq.yml` file generated by the `decidim` generator).

*Note that each process consumes a database connection. You need to be sure you infrastructure is properly configured not to exceed the concurrent number of connections that your database supports.* For this matter, check also the RAILS_MAX_THREADS param if you are using Puma.

If you want to use a cloud provider to storage user uploads. this can be done via next extra configuration variables.

Different providers require extra gems to be specified in your Gemfile. You can generate a new application with the appropriated gems with the command `decidim --storage=[provider] my-application`.

.Optional Decidim Env Vars for cloud storage settings
[%autowidth.stretch]
|===
|Name |Value |Default value|Multitenant's System configurable

|STORAGE_PROVIDER
|Which storage provider is going to be used for the application, provides support for the most popular options. Options are `local`, `s3` (compatible with any AWS-S3 service provider), `azure` (for Microsoft Cloud Storage), `gcs` (Google Cloud Services).

*If this setting is set to any other value than `local`, and additional gem for the specified service must be installed in the Gemfile of your application*. See https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html#setup[the official Rails guide] for details.
|local
|No

|STORAGE_CDN_HOST
|If you are using a cloud provider, having a CDN on top of it is probably a good idea. For instance, using a CloudFront distribution on top of a S3 configuration. But other services can be used as well (you can use https://cloudflare.com[CloudFlare] for free with excellent results).

Set the protocol, host and path to your CDN and all the user-generated files (through Active Storage) will be prefixed with this instead of serving files directly from the same domain of your application.

|
|No

|MAPS_API_KEY
|For a simple geolocation and tile maps service configuration define this value in case the provider needs it (if you are using Here Maps, you will need an API key). See xref:services:maps.adoc[Maps].

|
|No

.Additional Optional Decidim Env Vars for the setting up the application
[%autowidth.stretch]
|===
|Name |Value |Default value|Multitenant's System configurable

|DECIDIM_AVAILABLE_LOCALES
|a list of, coma separated, locales that will be available for each organization configured in the System configuration. Check for the https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/3d4ec74bdce406e2ee6934b830d3c06398ab72c0/decidim-core/lib/decidim/core.rb#L166[Supported values] in ISO639 format.

*Be careful while setting up this value, you can easily shoot yourself in the food as Decidim will crash if one of the languages is not supported*
|ca, cs, de, en, es, eu, fi, fr, it, ja, nl, pl, pt, ro
|*Partially*, Only when creating a new organization the admin needs to choose between these values

|DECIDIM_DEFAULT_LOCALE
|The default locale to be used as a fallback (note that, in practice, this value must always be defined in the System configuration for each organization anyway).

*Note that `DECIDIM_AVAILABLE_LOCALES` must include this value*
|en
|*Partially*, Only when creating a new organization

|DECIDIM_FORCE_SSL
|By default, Decidim enforces a SSL connection (https), sometimes it is necessary to disable it in order to handle this through a proxy system (note that use Decidim without SSL at all is NOT RECOMMENDED). This value can take 3 values:

`auto`: Will be `true` for Rails Production or Staging environments and `false` for development or test. If undefined, defaults to this value.

`true`: Will redirect to HTTPS always

`false`: Will not redirect to HTTPS

|auto
|No

| DECIDIM_PAGE_BLOCKS
| Sets the list of static pages' slugs that can include content blocks.
By default is only enabled in the terms-of-service static page to allow a summary to be added and include sections with a two-pane view
| terms-of-service
| no

|DECIDIM_ENABLE_HTML_HEADER_SNIPPETS
|Set to `true` in order to allow administrators to define an arbitrary custom HTML code in the `<head></head>` section any Decidim page.

The most common use is to integrate third-party services that require some
extra JavaScript or CSS. Also, you can use it to add extra meta tags to the
HTML. Note that this will only be rendered in public pages, not in the admin
section.

Before enabling this you should ensure that any tracking that might be done
is in accordance with the rules and regulations that apply to your
environment and usage scenarios. This component also comes with the risk
that an organization's administrator injects malicious scripts to spy on or
take over user accounts.
