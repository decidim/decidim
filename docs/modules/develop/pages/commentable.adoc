= Commentable

== Things can be commentable

`Commentable` is a feature to allow participants to comment on resources. This feature is used in many places in Decidim, like proposals, meetings, debates, etc.

When commenting a resource, the comments counter is increased and a notification to all the followers of the participant, the participatory space and/or the resource is sent.

Participants can comment with their own identity or with the identify of the `user_groups` they belong to.

== Data model

The `decidim_comments` table stores all the comments given to resources that are commentable. This is, one commentable has many comments, and each comment belongs to one commentable. Also, a comment can be a commentable itself, so comments can be nested.
For performance, a commentable has a counter cache of comments.

----
+----------------------+
|  Decidim::Commentable |
|   ((Proposal,...))   |                                  +-------------+
+----------------------+  0..N +-------------------+   +--+Decidim::User|
|-has_many comments    |-------+Decidim::Comment   |   |  +-------------+
|#counter cache column |       +-------------------+   |

+----------------------+       |         user or a |   |
                               |         user_group|   |  +------------------+
                               +-------------------+   +--+Decidim::UserGroup|

----

Thus, each commentable must have the comments counter cache column.
This is an example migration to add the comments counter cache column to a resource:

[source,ruby]
----
class AddCommentableCounterCacheToMeetings < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    add_column :decidim_meetings_meetings, :comments_count, :integer, null: false, default: 0
    Decidim::Meetings::Meeting.reset_column_information
    Decidim::Meetings::Meeting.find_each(&:update_comments_count)
  end
end

== Public view

=== The "Comment" cell

The `Comment` cell is used to render a comment in the public view. Usually, it is used in the `Comments` cell to render a list of comments.

[source,ruby]
----
cell("decidim/comments", resource)
----

This will render all the comments for the given resource.

=== Comments actions

Each comment has a set of actions that can be performed by the user. By default, these actions are available:

- A user can edit and delete their own comments.
- A user can report a comment.
- A user can copy the link to a comment.

These actions are available through a dropdown menu in the comment.

=== Resource-specific extra actions

Each resource can define extra actions that can be performed on comments. These actions must be returned by the resource object through the `actions_for_comment` method. If the resource does not define this method, or returns empty, no extra actions will be available.

This method will receive two parameters, the comment itself and the current user that wants to interact with the comment.

It must return an array of hashes, where each hash has the following keys:

- `label`: The text for the link for the action.
- `url`: The URL where the action will be performed.
- `icon`: The icon to be displayed for the action (optional).
- `method`: The HTTP method for the action, usually `:post` or `:delete` (optional as it defaults to `get`).
- `data`: A hash with the data attributes for the link (optional).

All these extra actions will be displayed in the dropdown menu of the comment after the default ones.

For example, this is how the `Proposal` model defines extra actions for comments:

[source,ruby]
----
def user_has_actions?(user)
  return false if authors.include?(user)
  return false if user&.blocked?
  return false if user&.deleted?
  return false unless user&.confirmed?

  true
end

def actions_for_comment(comment, current_user)
  return if comment.commentable != self
  return unless authors.include?(current_user)
  return unless user_has_actions?(comment.author)

  if coauthor_invitations_for(comment.author).any?
    [
      {
        label: I18n.t("decidim.proposals.actions.cancel_coauthor_invitation"),
        url: EngineRouter.main_proxy(component).cancel_proposal_invite_coauthors_path(proposal_id: id, id: comment.author.id),
        icon: "user-forbid-line",
        method: :delete,
        data: { confirm: I18n.t("decidim.proposals.actions.cancel_coauthor_invitation_confirm") }
      }
    ]
  else
    [
      {
        label: I18n.t("decidim.proposals.actions.mark_as_coauthor"),
        url: EngineRouter.main_proxy(component).proposal_invite_coauthors_path(proposal_id: id, id: comment.author.id),
        icon: "user-add-line",
        method: :post,
        data: { confirm: I18n.t("decidim.proposals.actions.mark_as_coauthor_confirm") }
      }
    ]
  end
end
----

This will render a new menu item with the text "Mark as coauthor" or "Cancel coauthor invitation" depending on the state of the comment author that will allow to add the comment's author as a co-author of the proposal.
