= Managing translations (i18n)

== The workflow

Decidim uses https://crowdin.com/[Crowdin] to manage the translations.

* Whenever someone https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/1814/files#diff-c78c80097da59920d55b3f462ca21afaR177[adds a new translation key] to _Decidim_, _Crowdin_ gets notified and the new content is available to be translated from https://crowdin.com/project/decidim[Crowdin's Decidim dashboard].
* When a translator translates any key from Crowdin, it automatically creates a https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20author%3Adecidim-bot%20Crowdin[PR in Github], adding the keys in the corresponding _yaml_ files.
* ðŸŒˆ

== Adding a new language

* Setup the new language in https://crowdin.com/project/decidim[_Crowdin's Decidim project_] (or open an issue on Github asking an admin to do that).
* Add the locale mapping in the `crowdin.yml` file
* Translate at least one key from every engine, so, your _yaml_ files are not empty. The easiest way to do this is to automatically translate and sync all the content. Later you'll be able to fix the content that wasn't properly translated.
* Add https://github.com/najlepsiwebdesigner/foundation-datepicker/tree/master/js/locales[Foundation Datepicker]'s translations (https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/2039[PR]).
* Add the new language to `available_locales` (https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/1991[PR]).
* Add the language in https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/5080/files#diff-9c9dc1c8c25dcecdfb8ce555d5ef5e47R15[decidim-core/spec/lib/available_locales_spec.rb].

== Test the new language

* Generate the development app and `cd` into it.
* Change the `config/initializer/decidim.rb` file and add your locale to `Decidim.available_locales`.
* `rake db:drop db:setup` to drop, create, load schema and seed the DB.
