= API

Decidim comes with a powerful API in read-only mode based in the GraphQL specification.

Documentation for this API is auto-generated in each instance of Decidim, usually under the URL:

`some_domain/api/docs`

Accessing that URL will give a full details of all the objects that can be requested and how.

For a quick introduction about how to use the Decidim API, please refer to this document:

xref:../../decidim-api/docs/usage.adoc[Using the Decidim GraphQL API]

Note that this document is available under the `api/docs` URL nicely formatted as well. It also includes the full field types reference.
