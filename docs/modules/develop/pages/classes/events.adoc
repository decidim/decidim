= Events

The concept regarding the notitication is being described in the xref:develop:notifications.adoc[Notifications] page.

Event classes are located in the `app/events/decidim/<my_plugin>` directory, and named: `<my_event>_event.rb`.

```ruby

module Decidim
  module MyPlugin
    class MyEvent < Decidim::Events::SimpleEvent
      # Defines a list of methods that will be used to translate the resource inside the event.
      i18n_attributes :example_resource_title

      # The name of the method can be 100% customized, but it must return a string.
      # the resource object used in the method body is the object that is being handled by the event.
      def example_resource_title
        translated_attribute(resource.title)
      end
    end
  end
end
```
