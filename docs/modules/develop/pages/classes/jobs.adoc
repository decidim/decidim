= Jobs

Decidim jobs classes are not do not implement anything different than what `ActiveJob` has to offer.

Form classes are located in the `app/jobs/decidim/<my_plugin>` directory, and named: `<my_custom_job>_job.rb`.

```ruby
module Decidim
  module MyPlugin
    class MyCustomJob < ActiveJob::Base
      queue_as :default

      def perform(*args)
        # Do something later
      end
    end
  end
end
```
