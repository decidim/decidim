= Jobs

Decidim jobs classes are not do not implement anything different than what `ActiveJob` has to offer.

Jobs classes are located in the `app/jobs/decidim/<my_module>` directory, and named: `<my_custom>_job.rb`.

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

# app/jobs/decidim/my_module/my_custom_job.rb
module Decidim
  module MyModule
    class MyCustomJob < ActiveJob::Base
      queue_as :default

      def perform(*args)
        # Do something later
      end
    end
  end
end
```
