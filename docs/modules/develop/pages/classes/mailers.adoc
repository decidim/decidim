= Mailers

The mailer class, is not that different than what default Rails has to offer.

Mail classes are located in the `app/mailers/decidim/<my_plugin>` directory, and named: `<my_custom_mail>_mailer.rb`.

```ruby
module Decidim
  module MyPlugin
    class MyCustomMailer <  < Decidim::ApplicationMailer
      def greeting(user)
        with_user(user) do
          @user = user

          subject = I18n.t("greeting.subject", scope: "decidim.my_plugin.mailer.my_custom_mailer")
          mail(to: user.email, subject:)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Please notice the `with_user` method, that is being used to set the locale of the mailer to the user's locale.
