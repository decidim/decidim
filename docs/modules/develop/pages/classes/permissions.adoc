= Permissions

The permission class allows you to customize the security. You can use the permission class to enforce the security on the basis of the user, group, or role.
You can read more about Decidim permissions in its own dedicated xref:develop:permissions.adoc[page].

Permission classes are located in the `app/permissions/decidim/<my_module>` directory, and named: `permissions.rb`.

The permission class is a simple class that inherits from `Decidim::DefaultPermissions`. And can be registered in a Permission chain among other chains that are provided by Decidim

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

# app/permissions/decidim/my_module/permissions.rb
module Decidim
  module MyModule
    class Permissions < Decidim::DefaultPermissions
      def permissions
        # skip to the next chain
        return permission_action unless user
        # pass to the next chain, as the requested authorization
        # is not in scope of this permission class
        return permission_action if permission_action.scope != :public

        # allow public read of the resource
        permission_action.allow! if permission_action.action == :read

        # allow full access to the resource if the user is the owner
        # authored_by? is a method that you need to implement in your model by including
        # Decidim::Authorable concern
        permission_action.allow! if my_object.authored_by?(user)

        # we return the permission chain
        permission_action
      end

      private

      def my_object
        @my_object ||= context.fetch(:my_object, nil)
      end

    end
  end
end
```

Now that you have defined the permission class, you will need to properly register. Inside your component definition, you can populate the permissions_class_name parameter as follows:

```ruby

Decidim.register_component(:meetings) do |component|
  component.permissions_class_name = "Decidim::MyModule::Permissions"
end
```

If your controller does not handle a Decidim component (or associated), you can customize as follows in your controller:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

# app/controllers/decidim/my_module/my_resource_controller.rb
module Decidim
  module MyModule
    class MyResourceController < Decidim::MyModule::ApplicationController
      include NeedsPermission

      register_permissions(Decidim::MyModule::MyResourceController,
                           ::Decidim::MyModule::Permissions,
                           ::Decidim::Permissions)

      private

      def permission_class_chain
        ::Decidim.permissions_registry.chain_for(::Decidim::MyModule::MyResourceController)
      end

      def permission_scope
        :public
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Once you have defined those changes, you can use in your controllers the following statement:

```ruby
def index
  enforce_permission_to :read, :resource
  # other code specific for your business model
end
```
You can also pass parameters to the `enforce_permission_to` method, as follows:

```ruby
def index
  enforce_permission_to :read, :resource, my_object: resource
  # other code specific for your business model
end

```

Or you can check for permissions in the views:

```erb
<% if allowed_to? :read, :resource %>
  <p> You can read this resource </p>
<% end %>
```
You can also pass parameters to the `allowed_to` method, as follows:

```erb
<% if allowed_to? :read, :resource, my_object: resource %>
  <p> You can read this resource </p>
<% end %>
```
