= Commands

A command is custom class that manages the logic between your input, usually a xref:develop:classes/forms.adoc[form] object, an object and an user.

Usually, a command is used to handle the interaction between the controller and the model.

Commands are located in the `app/commands/decidim/<my_module>` directory, and named: `<action>_<my_resource>.rb`.

Because most of the time, a command is used to create, update a resource, we are shipping 3 commands by default, which you can inherit in your own commands:

- xref:_decidimcommandscreateresource[`Decidim::Commands::CreateResource`] - for creating resources
- xref:_decidimcommandsupdateresource[`Decidim::Commands::UpdateResource`] - for updating resources
- xref:_decidimcommandsdestroyresource[`Decidim::Commands::DestroyResource`] - for destroying resources

== Decidim::Commands::CreateResource

In order to create a resource, you need to provide the form with the values you want to create.

This is a custom implementation for demonstration purposes:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

# app/commands/decidim/my_module/create_my_resource.rb
module Decidim
  module MyModule
    class CreateMyResource < Decidim::Commands::CreateResource
      # Tell the parent class which fields are going to be
      # copied from the form
      fetch_form_attributes :title, :description, :component

      # This is the class initializer. It can be ignored if you do not need
      # to do anything special.
      def initialize(form)
        @form = form
      end

      private
      # Tell the parent what is the AcitveRecord class needed
      def resource_class = Decidim::MyModule::MyResource

      # This method allows you to customize the log visbility
      def extra_params = { visibility: "all" }

      # The command has a before hook that you can use:
      def run_before_hooks
        # do something
      end

      # The command has an after hook that you can use:
      def run_after_hooks
        # do something
      end

      # Addtionally, you can override the `attributes` method
      # to add more attributes to the resource
      def attributes
        super.merge({
          my_custom_attribute: form.my_custom_attribute
        })
      end

      # You can also provide a custom form validation
      # by overriding the `invalid?` method
      def invalid?
        return true if form.my_custom_attribute.blank?
        super
      end
    end
  end
end
```

== Decidim::Commands::UpdateResource

In order to update a resource, you need to provide the resource you want to update, and the form with the new values.

This is a custom implementation for demonstration purposes:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

# app/commands/decidim/my_module/update_my_resource.rb
module Decidim
  module MyModule
    class UpdateMyResource < Decidim::Commands::UpdateResource
      # Tell the parent class which fields are going to be
      # copied from the form
      fetch_form_attributes :title, :description, :component

      # This is the class initializer. It can be ignored if you do not need
      # to do anything special.
      def initialize(form, resource)
        @form = form
        @resource = resource
      end

      private
      # Tell the parent what is the AcitveRecord class needed
      def resource_class = Decidim::MyModule::MyResource

      # This method allows you to customize the log visbility
      def extra_params = { visibility: "all" }

      # The command has a before hook that you can use:
      def run_before_hooks
        # do something
      end

      # The command has an after hook that you can use:
      def run_after_hooks
        # do something
      end

      # Addtionally, you can override the `attributes` method
      # to add more attributes to the resource
      def attributes
        super.merge({
          my_custom_attribute: form.my_custom_attribute
        })
      end

      # You can also provide a custom form validation
      # by overriding the `invalid?` method
      def invalid?
        return true if form.my_custom_attribute.blank?
        super
      end
    end
  end
end
```

== Decidim::Commands::DestroyResource

If you do not need to do anything special, you can just call this command for any resource you want to destroy.

If you still want to customize the command, you can do it like this:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

# app/commands/decidim/my_module/destroy_my_resource.rb
module Decidim
  module MyModule
    class DestoryMyResource < Decidim::Commands::DestroyResource
      # This is the class initializer, that can be safely ignored if you do not perform additional actions
      def initialize(resource, current_user)
        @resource = resource
        @current_user = current_user
      end

      private

      # This method allows you to customize the log visbility
      def extra_params = { visibility: "all" }

      # The command has a before hook that you can use:
      def run_before_hooks
        # do something
      end

      # The command has an after hook that you can use:
      def run_after_hooks
        # do something
      end

      # You can also provide a custom validation by overriding the `invalid?` method
      def invalid? = false
    end
  end
end
```

== Advanced usage

In the below example, you will be able to see an advanced example on how you can write your custom command (`CreateMyResource`), events (`Decidim::MyModule::MyResourceEvent`) and jobs (`Decidim::MyModule::MyCustomJob`) can be used.

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

# app/commands/decidim/my_module/create_my_resource.rb
module Decidim
  module MyModule
    # A command with the business logic to create a resource.
    class CreateMyResource < Decidim::Command
      # Public: Initializes the command.
      #
      def initialize(form, resource)
        @form = form
        @resource = resource
      end

      def call
        return broadcast(:invalid) if form.invalid?

        transation do
          create_resource
          dispatch_event
          process_jobs
        end
        broadcast(:ok)
      end

      private

      attr_reader :form, :resource

      def process_jobs
        Decidim::MyModule::MyCustomJob.perform_later(resource)
      end

      def dispatch_event
        Decidim::EventsManager.publish(
          event: "decidim.events.my_module.my_resource_created",
          event_class: Decidim::MyModule::MyResourceEvent,
          resource:
        )
      end

      def create_resource
        @resource = Decidim.traceability.create!(
          resource,
          form.current_user,
          **attributes,
          visibility: "public-only"
        )
      end

      # this is mapping of
      # ActiveRecord::attribute => form.attribute
      def attributes
        {
          title: form.title,
          description: form.description,
          resource: form.resource
        }
      end
    end
  end
end
```

== Overriding Decidim commands

Sometimes you may need to extend a `Decidim` supplied command, then you can either override the `attributes` method, either extend it with a `super` call.

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

# app/lib/overrides/commands/create_my_resource.rb
module Decidim
  module Overrides
    module Commands
      module CreateMyResource
        def attributes
          super.merge(
            {
              my_custom_attribute: form.my_custom_attribute
            }
          )
        end
      end
    end
  end
end

Decidim::MyModule::CreateMyResource.prepend(Decidim::Overrides::Commands::CreateMyResource)
```
