= Cells


As explained in dedicated page xref:develop:view_models_aka_cells.adoc[View Models (Cells)], a cell is an object that represent a fragment of your UI

In order to define a cell, you need to create a class that inherits from `Decidim::ViewModel` in your plugin. The path where the cell class needs to be defined id `app/cells/decidim/<your_plugin>/<your_cell_name>_cell.rb`

For example, if you want to create a cell that renders a simple text:

```ruby
# app/cells/decidim/my_plugin/my_cell_cell.rb
module Decidim
  module MyPlugin
    class MyCellCell < Decidim::ViewModel
      def render
        "Hello World!"
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Then, you can render the cell in your view:

```ruby
cell("decidim/my_plugin/my_cell")
```
