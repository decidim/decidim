= Cells

As explained in dedicated page xref:develop:view_models_aka_cells.adoc[View Models (Cells)], a cell is an object that represent a fragment of your UI.

In order to define a cell, you need to create a class that inherits from `Decidim::ViewModel` in your module.

Cells classes are located in the `app/cells/decidim/<my_module>` directory, and named: `<my_cell>_cell.rb`.

For example, if you want to create a cell that renders a simple text:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

# app/cells/decidim/my_module/my_cell_cell.rb
module Decidim
  module MyModule
    class MyCellCell < Decidim::ViewModel

      def show
        render if condition?
      end

      private

      def condition?
        true
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Then, you can render the cell in your view:

```erb
<%= cell("decidim/my_module/my_cell") =>
```
