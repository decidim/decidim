= Architecture 

If you have worked in the past with Ruby on Rails, you'll notice quickly that Decidim is *not* your typical Ruby on Rails Vanilla App.

We've tried using http://decide.es[Consul] but we found some problems on reutilization, adaptation, modularization and configuration. You can read more about that on https://alabs.gitbooks.io/propuesta-de-cambios-en-la-arquitectura-de-consul/content/[Propuesta de Cambios de Arquitectura de Consul (in spanish only)]. As a summary, we decided to try with a model based in https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html[RoR Engines]. A good resource regarding this approach is https://cbra.info/[Component Based Rails Applications].

== What this means

This means that:

. Decidim is a https://rubygems.org/gems/decidim[gem], available in rubygems.org. You can install it with the command `gem install decidim`
. Decidim is a command line generator of Ruby on Rails applications. After you've install it you can generate a new RoR app with `decidim HelloWorld`
. This app has a dependency the gem itself. You can see this in the Gemfile of the generated app.
. This app can be extended by making changes in the app (see xref:customize:index.adoc[Customising]) and by working with https://decidim.org/modules[Modules].

== Examples

Here are some good examples of what can be done with Decidim: 

=== Helsinki OmaStadi

Some highlights: 

* They have their https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/decidim-helsinki/blob/b9a09e570eb6090dee93f2ee73b5951882c74755/Gemfile[Gemfile] with lots of modules with their own code. Some of them are also in ruybgems (like `decidim-access_requests`, `decidim-antivirus`, `decidim-mpassid`, `decidim-process_groups_content_block`, `decidim-suomifi`, `decidim-term_customizer`), others are only in Github (`decidim-accountability_simple`, `decidim-apiauth`, `decidim-combined_budgeting`, `decidim-plans`, `decidim-redirects`). They even use a module made by other organization in the community (`decidim-budgets_enhanced`)
* They have their UI customized to their needs. See the https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/decidim-helsinki/tree/a7396a312cc04198654a86d66c2a7de556c212af/app/assets/stylesheets[CSS] and https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/decidim-helsinki/tree/a7396a312cc04198654a86d66c2a7de556c212af/app/views[HTML (views)].
* They have an awesome READE explaining how it works and what changes have made.
