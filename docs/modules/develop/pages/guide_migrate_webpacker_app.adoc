= Migrate to Webpacker an instance app

In order to migrate an existing Decidim app to Webpacker, there are a few changes your need to run in your code.

Disclaimer: this recipe might not work for all the cases, it tries to cover the generic scenarios. If you find yourself with a complex scenario and want to improve this guide feel free to open a PR to complete the guide.

== About Webpacker

It's recommended to understand how Webpacker works. More information:

* https://github.com/rails/webpacker#usage
* https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/webpacker.html

== Add Webpacker to the application

Follow the steps descibed https://github.com/rails/webpacker#installation[here]

1. Add it to your Gemfile

[source, console]
----
# Gemfile
gem 'webpacker', '~> 6.x'

# OR if you prefer to use master
gem 'webpacker', git: 'https://github.com/rails/webpacker.git'
npm install https://github.com/rails/webpacker.git
----

2. Install it

[source,console]
----
bundle install
bundle exec rails webpacker:install
----

3. Install npm dependencies

[source,console]
----
npm install
----

== Add Decidim webpacker configuration

(when using Decidim generators this file is created automatically)

Decidim has a specific Webpacker configuration that needs to be manually copied in existing applications.

Copy the file https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/develop/decidim-generators/lib/decidim/generators/app_templates/decidim_webpacker.yml[decidim_webpacker.yml] to `config/` folder and edit it:

[source,console]
----
# Replace
APP_PATH

# By the location of the instance Rails app, depending on the environment. For example, for an app called your_decidim_app in /home/ubuntu/your_decidim_app
/home/ubuntu/dev/your_decidim_app/app/packs

# If your application is in production you might need to adapt this change for each environment
----

== Add Decidim webpacker initializer

(when using Decidim generators this file is created automatically)

Copy the file https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/develop/decidim-generators/lib/decidim/generators/app_templates/webpacker_initializer.rb[webpacker_initializer.rb] to `config/initializers/webpacker.rb`

== Copy Decidim custom CSS and Javascript

`webpacker:install` task should have created to you the following dirs structure:

```
app/packs:
  ├── entrypoints
  └── src
  └── stylesheets
  └── images
```

If it's not the case you must create it. Then, copy Decidim customizable assets

* Copy the file https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/develop/decidim-generators/lib/decidim/generators/app_templates/decidim_application.js[decidim_application.js] to `app/packs/src/decidim/decidim_application.js`
* Copy the file https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/develop/decidim-generators/lib/decidim/generators/app_templates/decidim-settings.scss[decidim-settings.scss] to `app/packs/stylesheets/decidim/decidim-settings.scss`

These files are hooked into Decidim packs (specifically into decidim-core pack) and will be automatically included inside that pack when compiled.

== Migrate images

Copy the existing images from `app/assets/images` to `app/packs/images`. Images will be available at `/media/images/image.png`

== Migrate stylesheets

Existing stylesheets should be moved from `app/assets/stylesheets` to `app/packs/stylesheets` and imported with `@import` into `decidim_application.scss`. Take into account that you might need to adjust a bit the paths of the `@import` to adjust them to the new locations.

If that CSS file is replacing a Decidim file, there's no need to add it to `decidim_application.scss`.

If any of the CSS is re-defining CSS vars should be renamed to `_decidim-settings.scss`.

== Migrate javascripts

Existing javascripts should be moved from `app/assets/javascsripts` to `app/packs/src` and imported with `import` into `decidim_application.js`. Take into account that you might need to adjust a bit the paths of the `import` to adjust them to the new locations.

If that JS file is replacing a Decidim file, there's no need to add it to `decidim_application.js`

== Update Rails helpers

`javascript_include_tag` and `stylesheet_link_tag` have been replaced by `javascript_pack_tag` and `stylesheet_pack_tag`.

For images, if they are in `app/packs/images` you could use `image_pack_tag`.

== Migrate vendorized files and gems

Sometimes assets are included in `vendor/assets/` folder or imported from gems. For each specific one you should check:

1. if the asset is a javascript that is available as npm package the recommendation is to add it to package.json with `npm install`. If it's not available you might want to copy it to `app/packs/src` and import it.
2. if the asset is a stylesheet it should be copied to `app/packs/stylesheets` and imported with `@import...` from `decidim-settings.scss`

== Remove manifest

The manifest at `app/assets/config` is not necessary anymore and should be removed. Then the whole `app/assets` folder can be removed.
