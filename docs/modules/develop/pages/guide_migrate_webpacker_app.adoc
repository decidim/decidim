= Migrate to Webpacker an instance app

In order to migrate an existing Decidim app to Webpacker, there are a few changes your need to run in your code.

Disclaimer: this recipe might not work for all the cases, it tries to cover the generic scenarios. If you find yourself with a complex scenario and want to improve this guide feel free to open a PR to complete the guide.

== About Webpacker

It's recommended to understand how Webpacker works. More information:

* https://github.com/rails/webpacker#usage
* https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/webpacker.html

== Requirements

Before starting the migration, please check you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js version 15.14.0 (this version is mandatory)
- Npm version 7.7.0 (it works with other versions, but this is the recommended)

== Add Webpacker to the application

Follow the steps described https://github.com/rails/webpacker#installation[here]

- Install it

[source,console]
----
bundle exec rails webpacker:install
----

* Install Decidim webpacker custom code

[source,console]
----
bundle exec rails decidim:webpacker:install
----

This task do a few steps to allow the Rails instance to have a webpacker instance sharing the code between itself and Decidim gem.

This task is automatically performed every time decidim is updated, to get the latest Webpack configuration. This happens when you run the `decidim:upgrade` task.

== Copy Decidim custom CSS and Javascript

`webpacker:install` task should have created to you the following dirs structure:

[source,console]
----
app/packs:
  ├── entrypoints
  └── src
  └── stylesheets
  └── images
----

If it's not the case you must create it. Then, copy Decidim customizable assets

* Copy the file https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/develop/decidim-generators/lib/decidim/generators/app_templates/decidim_application.js[decidim_application.js] to `app/packs/src/decidim/decidim_application.js`
* Copy the file https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/develop/decidim-generators/lib/decidim/generators/app_templates/decidim_application.scss[decidim_application.scss] to `app/packs/stylesheets/decidim/decidim_application.scss`
* Copy the file https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/develop/decidim-generators/lib/decidim/generators/app_templates/_decidim-settings.scss[_decidim-settings.scss] to `app/packs/stylesheets/decidim/_decidim-settings.scss`

These files are hooked into Decidim packs (specifically into decidim-core pack) and will be automatically included inside that pack when compiled.

== Migrate images

Copy the existing images from `app/assets/images` to `app/packs/images`. Images will be available at `/media/images/image.png`

== Migrate stylesheets

Existing stylesheets should be moved from `app/assets/stylesheets` to `app/packs/stylesheets` and imported with `@import` into `decidim_application.scss`. Take into account that you might need to adjust a bit the paths of the `@import` to adjust them to the new locations.

If that CSS file is replacing a Decidim file, there's no need to add it to `decidim_application.scss`.

If any of the CSS is re-defining CSS vars add them to `_decidim-settings.scss`.

== Migrate javascripts

Existing javascripts should be moved from `app/assets/javascsripts` to `app/packs/src` and imported with `import` into `decidim_application.js`. Take into account that you might need to adjust a bit the paths of the `import` to adjust them to the new locations.

If that JS file is replacing a Decidim file, there's no need to add it to `decidim_application.js`

== Update Rails helpers

`javascript_include_tag` and `stylesheet_link_tag` have been replaced by `javascript_pack_tag` and `stylesheet_pack_tag`.

For images, if they are in `app/packs/images` you could use `image_pack_tag`.

== Migrate vendorized files and gems

Sometimes assets are included in `vendor/assets/` folder or imported from gems. For each specific one you should check:

1. if the asset is a javascript that is available as npm package the recommendation is to add it to package.json with `npm install`. If it's not available you might want to copy it to `app/packs/src` and import it.
2. if the asset is a stylesheet it should be copied to `app/packs/stylesheets` and imported with `@import...` from `_decidim-settings.scss`. Alternatively you can use the optional asset includes as described below to include these in the Decidim main SCSS files.

== Optional asset includes

Decidim Webpacker provides a new configuration convention that allows you to add extra configurations for webpacker using a configuration file named `config/assets.rb`. Within this file, you have the following API methods available:

[source,ruby]
----
# frozen_string_literal: true
# This file is located at `config/assets.rb` of your module.

# Define the base path of your module. Please note that `Rails.root` may not be
# used because we are not inside the Rails environment when this file is loaded.
base_path = File.expand_path("..", __dir__)

# If you want to import some extra SCSS files in the Decidim main SCSS file
# without adding any extra stylesheet inclusion tags, you can use the following
# method to register the stylesheet import for the main application. This would
# include an SCSS file at `app/packs/stylesheets/your_app_extensions.scss` into
# the Decidim's main SCSS file.
Decidim::Webpacker.register_stylesheet_import("stylesheets/your_app_extensions")

# If you want to do the same but include the SCSS file for the admin panel's
# main SCSS file, you can use the following method.
Decidim::Webpacker.register_stylesheet_import("stylesheets/your_app_admin_extensions", group: :admin)
----

== Remove Sprockets references

The completely remove Sprockets references from your application:

* Review your Gemfile and remove any reference to `sprockets` and `sassc-rails`
* Remove `config/initializers/assets.rb`
* Remove `app/assets` folder
* In `config/application.rb` replace:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'rails/all'
----

with:

[source,ruby]
----
require "rails"
# Pick the frameworks you want:
require "active_model/railtie"
require "active_job/railtie"
require "active_record/railtie"
require "active_storage/engine"
require "action_controller/railtie"
require "action_mailer/railtie"
require "action_mailbox/engine"
require "action_text/engine"
require "action_view/railtie"
require "action_cable/engine"
# require "sprockets/railtie"
require "rails/test_unit/railtie"
----

* In `config/environments/*.rb` remove any line containing `config.assets.*` (i.e `config.assets.debug = true`)

== Deployment

The deployment needs to be updated to manually run `npm install` before assets are precompiled.

In the case of Capistrano this can be done with a before hook:

[source,ruby]
----
namespace :deploy do
  desc "Decidim webpacker configuration"
  task :decidim_webpacker_install do
    on roles(:all) do
      within release_path do
        with rails_env: fetch(:rails_env) do
          execute "npm ci"
        end
      end
    end
  end

  before "deploy:assets:precompile", "deploy:decidim_webpacker_install"
end
----

Also, in the case of Capistrano it's interesting to add to the shared_paths the following folders:

* `tmp/webpacker-cache`
* `node_modules`
* `public/decidim-packs`
