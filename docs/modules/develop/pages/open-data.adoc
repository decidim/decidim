= Open Data

In order for users to be able to download Open Data files they have to be generated previously, since generating them on the fly would take too much time and resources.

You should schedule this command to be run everyday, using `cron` or `whenever` or your favorite tool:

[source,ruby]
----
  bundle exec rake decidim:open_data:export
----
