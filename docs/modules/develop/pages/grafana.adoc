# Grafana

For improving the data visualization capabilities of Decidim, we have a working dashboard that can be imported to Grafana, an open-source observability and monitoring platform that allows users to visualize metrics, logs, and traces in real time from various data sources.

## Initial set-up

The steps for having this dashboard are the following. For this tutorial we will use link:https://grafana.com[Grafana Cloud]

. Go to http://grafana.com

+

. Click in button "Create account"
. Fill the account creation form with your information

. Confirm your email address

## Methods

Then, you have two options for connecting to any Decidim instance.

a. CSV (Comma-Separated Values): A simple file format used to store tabular data, such as spreadsheets or databases. Each line in a CSV file represents a row, with values separated by commas or other separators (semi colons in the case of Decidim).

b. GraphQL: A query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries. It allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and improving performance.

For demonstration purposes, we will use the link:https://meta.decidim.org[Metadecidim installation].

|CSV
|GraphQL

|Using the Open Data features from https://meta.decidim.org/open-data
|Using the GraphQL API features from https://meta.decidim.org/api

|Only has access to the last 24 hours data
|Has real-time access

|Has access to all the public data
|Has a limit on the number of resources. See link:https://github.com/grafana/grafana-infinity-datasource/discussions/601[Pagination of API responses]
|===

So, taking into account the last limitation from the Grafana Infinity GraphQL connector, **we recommend using the CSV method** if you need to access more than the last 10 or 20 resources.

## Examples

As a starting point to check-out the possibilities of this integration, we have provided some examples with the two methods.

### GraphQL example

## Import

For importing any of these methods, follow these instructions:

. Go to the "Dashboards" page and in the "New" button click in the "Import" option

. In the text area, paste the contents of any of the examples provided (see below).

. Click in the "Import" button

+

. Then you will see the imported Dashboard. Even though the examples are based on Metadecidim, are a good starting point to understand how to connect any Decidim API with Grafana.
