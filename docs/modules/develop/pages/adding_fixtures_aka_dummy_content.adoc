= How to add dummy content to a development application?

== Proposals example

. In decidim-proposals open `lib/decidim/proposals/component.rb`.
. Find the `+component.seeds do...+` block.
. Create your dummy content as if you were in a `db/seed.rb` script.
 ** Take advantage of the Faker gem, already in decidim.
 ** You can use https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/master/decidim-core/lib/decidim/faker/localized.rb, which uses `Faker` internally, if you need content for i18n fields.
