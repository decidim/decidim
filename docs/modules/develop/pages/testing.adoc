= How to test Decidim engines

== Requirements

You need to create a dummy application to run your tests. Run the following command in the decidim root's folder:

[source,bash]
----
bundle exec rake test_app
----

== Running a specific test file or just a single spec

If you are writing new specs, you can run the tests contained in a single file by opening a console window in the corresponding module and calling ``rspec``on the file. For example:

[source,bash]
----
cd decidim-participatory_processes
bundle exec rspec spec/forms/participatory_process_form_spec.rb
----

You can also run a single test by appending its start line number to the command:

[source,bash]
----
bundle exec rspec spec/forms/participatory_process_form_spec.rb:134
----

== Running tests for a specific component

A Decidim engine can be tested running the rake task named after it. For
example, to test the proposals engine, you can run:

[source,bash]
----
bundle exec rake test_proposals
----

== Running the whole test suite

You can also run the full thing including test application generation and tests
for all components by running

[source,bash]
----
bundle exec rake test_all
----

But beware, it takes a long time... :)
