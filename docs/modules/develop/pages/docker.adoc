= Docker for development

You can also use https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[docker] && https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[docker-compose] to develop decidim. You'll
need to install those but in exchange you don't need to install any other
dependency in your computer, not even Ruby!

To get started, first clone the decidim repo

[source,console]
----
git clone https://github.com/decidim/decidim
----

Switch to the cloned folder

[source,console]
----
cd decidim
----

Then create a development application

[source,console]
----
d/bundle install
d/rake development_app
d/rails server -b 0.0.0.0
----

In general, to use the docker development environment, change any instruction in
the docs to use its equivalent docker binstub.  So for example, instead of
running `bundle install`, you would run `d/bundle install`.
