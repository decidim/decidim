= Upgrading

We keep releasing new versions of Decidim. In order to get the latest one, update your dependencies:

[source,console]
----
bundle update decidim
----

And make sure you get all the latest migrations:

[source,console]
----
bin/rails decidim:upgrade
bin/rails db:migrate
----

You can also make sure new translations are complete for all languages in your
application with:

[source,console]
----
bin/rails decidim:check_locales
----

Be aware that this task might not be able to detect everything, so make sure you
also manually check your application before upgrading.
