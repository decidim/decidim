= Authorizations

Decidim offers several methods for allowing participants to get authorization to perform certain privileged actions. This module implements several of those methods and also offers a way for installation to implement their custom verification methods.

There are several use cases for this, such as

* Sending a SMS code to users to verify that their have a valid cellphone
* Allowing users to upload a photo or scanned image of their identity document
* Sending users a code through postal code
* Allowing users to go to to a physical office and check their documentation
* Checking some information through other systems (as a Municipal Census on the case of Municipalities, Cities or Towns)
* Having a list of valid users emails

Currently Decidim supports only a few of these cases, but we have an internal API where you can program your own kind of authorizations.

== Introduction

Each Decidim instance is in full control of its authorizations, and can customize:

* The different methods to be used by users to get verified. For example, through a census, by uploading their identity documents, or by receiving a verification home at their address.
* The different actions in decidim that require authorization, and which authorization method they require. For example, a decidim instance might choose to require census authorization to create proposals, but a fully verified address via a verification code sent by postal mail for voting on proposals.

See https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/develop/decidim-verifications/README.md[decidim-verifications's README] and https://decidim.org/modules[Decidim's Modules page].

The default Decidim application comes pre-configured with some example authorization strategies that you can test to get familiar with the system. If you want to verify yourself with these strategies, please follow these instructions:

- For the "Example authorization" strategy, use a document number ended with "X". Other details can be as you wish.
- For the "Another example authorization", use a passport number starting with "A". Other details can be as you wish.
