== Custom services

If you have the need, you can enable your own service. To do that, as an example for a ficticious social service called "Foo", you'll need to follow these steps:

. Add the logo of your service to the images' pack at `app/packs/images/`. Following the example, it'd be "foo.svg"

. Add the social share service block configuration at the bottom of your Decidim initializer:

[source,ruby]
----
Decidim.register_social_share_service("Foo") do |service|
  service.icon = "foo.svg"
  service.share_uri = "https://foo.example.com/share?url=%{url}"
end
----

[NOTE]
----
Depending on the service, you could use the following variables in the share URI:
* url
* title
* desc
* image
----

. Add the "Foo" service to `DECIDIM_SOCIAL_SHARE_SERVICES` environment variable.
