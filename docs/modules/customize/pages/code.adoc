= Code

If you want to override/change anything, you can just do it with the same name of the file, through Monkey Patching. Some real world examples of this method:

* https://github.com/gencat/participa/blob/master/app/decorators/decidim/admin/selective_newsletter_form_decorator.rb[Decidim::Admin::SelectiveNewsletterForm]. As it's a decorator you also need to make it available in the https://github.com/gencat/participa/blob/3416992ae095f6ab1e826fee961253514c4ff0ef/config/application.rb#L48[application config]
* https://github.com/barcelonaregional/decidim-premet25/blob/master/config/initializers/etiquette_validator.rb[EtiquetteValidator.class_eval]

If you want to extend Decidim, the preferred way should be by having a Module. This is a Ruby on Rails Engine which provides ruby code (models, views, controllers, assets, etc). You can use it in multiple ways:

* Putting it on the same directory as your app and pointing on the Gemfile. https://github.com/AjuntamentdeBarcelona/decidim-barcelona/tree/c210b5338d7ba1338c9879627e081da1441f1946[See example on GitHub]. For instance:

[source,ruby]
----
gem "decidim-debates", path: "decidim-debates"
----

* Publishing on a git repository and pointing in on the Gemfile. For instance:

[source,ruby]
----
gem "decidim-consultations", git: "https://github.com/decidim/decidim-module-consultations"
----

* Publishing it on rubygems.org
