= Changing the Date Format

By default, the date format in Decidim follows the *day-month-year (d-m-y)* order. If users wish to customize this format according to their localization preferences, they can do so by modifying the relevant i18n key.

== How to Change the Date Format

The date format is defined in the `decidim-core/config/locales/en.yml` file. The specific key that controls this format is:

[source,yaml]
----
help:
  date_format: 'Format: dd/mm/yyyy'
order: d-m-y
----

=== Steps to Customize

1. Open the `decidim-core/config/locales/en.yml` file.
2. Locate the `help.date_format` and `order` keys.
3. Modify the format as needed. For example, to switch to a *month-day-year (m-d-y)* format:

[source,yaml]
----
help:
  date_format: 'Format: mm/dd/yyyy'
order: m-d-y
----

4. Save the changes and restart your application to apply the new format.

This ensures that users see date values formatted in a way that aligns with their localization preferences.
