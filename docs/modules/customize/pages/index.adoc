Decidim is multiple things:

* A command-line utility, which can create an application
* A set of libraries, that the application can use

Most of the time, you should work with the generated application. That application (development_app on this docs) should be named as your project, for instance for Barcelona City Council is `DecidimBarcelona`, so for creating it should be:

[source,console]
----
decidim DecidimBarcelona
----

Inside of your application you can customize it in different ways:
