== Notifications digest
This is an email with all the notifications activity summarized. It's generated for the users that
have checked the `email_on_notification` option in their user panel. Also the can set the frequency they want
to receive the emails in the `notifications_sending_frequency` option.

There are two tasks to send the mail notifications digest. The email will be send depending on when you set the job in the crontab.
