= Gemfile

You can add and change your Gemfile as you want, this is a classic Ruby on Rails application. For example to add https://github.com/josevalim/rails-footnotes[rails-footnotes] gem you would just add:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'rails-footnotes', '~> 4.0'
----

And then just do the classic Ruby on Rails flow bundle install and following any gem specific install steps from its own documentation.
