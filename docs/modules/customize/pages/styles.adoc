= CSS Styles with SASS

One of the first things you will want to do after you install Decidim is applying your own corporative image. You can do it on multiple ways:

== Organization colors

If you only want to change colors and anything more, the most easy and fast way is doing this in the Administrator panel, in Administration -> Configuration -> Appearance (URL `/admin/organization/appearance/edit`):

image::organization-colors.png[Organization colors]

This works for any Organization inside of a Multitenant.

== Head extra file

There is an special partial file for adding inline content in every public page. You just need to create a file called `app/views/layouts/decidim/_head_extra.html.erb`:

[source,stylesheet]
----
<style type="text/css">
 p { color: red; }
</style>
----

== Custom HTML Header snippets

If you need changes on a multitenant installation, you can do so by enabling a configuration
using your environment variables. Please do notice that this has security implications:

[source,bash]
----
export DECIDIM_ENABLE_HTML_HEADER_SNIPPETS=true
----

Then you will have a new textarea field called "Header snippets" in Administration -> Configuration -> Appearance (URL `/admin/organization/appearance/edit`):

image::header-snippet.png[Header snippet]

Notice that you can resize this textarea.

== Shakapacker

Decidim uses Shakapacker to compile assets. There are two ways to customize CSS:

1. if you want to redefine a specific snippet of CSS (say a few classes but not a whole file) you can use decidim_application.scss. You can read more about this in the <<Overriding CSS and styles>> section.
2. and of course you can overwrite whole files by copying them into the application i.e: to replace `decidim-core/app/packs/stylesheets/decidim/modules/_data-consent.scss` you should create in your Rails app a file in `app/packs/stylesheets/decidim/modules/_data-consent.scss` and it will have more priority over the Decidim file.
3. if you want to customize the application colors yo can use the admin interface.

We use http://sass-lang.com/guide[SASS, with SCSS syntax] as CSS preprocessor.

== Tailwind CSS

Decidim uses Tailwind CSS as a CSS framework, which has a default configuration that is being handled by `tailwind.config.js` in the root of your project.

Since this file is being managed by Decidim, it will be impossible to customize it.

You can override the default configuration by creating a file  `config/tailwind.config.js.erb` starting from the following https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/develop/decidim-core/lib/decidim/assets/tailwind/tailwind.config.js.erb[content]

== Overriding CSS and styles

If you want to override a specific CSS class, you can do so by adding a new CSS class in your `app/assets/stylesheets/decidim_application.scss` file. This will allow you to override the default styles provided by Decidim.

*Please note:* the above file is created by default when you install Decidim. Also the file is empty. This file allows you to edit *only* the end user styles.

If you want to override other layouts, you can do so by creating new files:

. /admin: `app/packs/stylesheets/decidim/admin/decidim_application.scss`
. /system: `app/packs/stylesheets/decidim/system/decidim_application.scss`

== Accessibility

To maintain accessibility level, if you add new colors use a http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/[Color contrast checker] (WCAG AA is mandatory, WCAG AAA is recommended)

For more information about accessibility, see the xref:develop:guide_accessibility.adoc[accessibility guide].
