= CSS Styles with SASS

One of the first things you'll want to do after you install Decidim is applying your own corporative image. You can do it on multiple ways:

== Organization colors

If you only want to change colors and anything more, the most easy and fast way is doing this in the Administrator panel, in Administration -> Configuration -> Appearance (URL `/admin/organization/appearance/edit`):

image::organization-colors.png[Organization colors]

This works for any Organization inside of a Muiltitenant.

== Head extra file

There's an special partial file for adding inline content in every public page. You just need to create a file called `app/views/layouts/decidim/_head_extra.html.erb`:

[source,stylesheet]
----
<style type="text/css">
 p { color: red; }
</style>
----

== Custom HTML Header snippets

If you need changes on a multitenant installation, you can do so by enabling a configuration
in your `config/initializers/decidim.rb` file. Please do notice that this has security implications:

[source,ruby]
----
  # Custom HTML Header snippets
  #
  # The most common use is to integrate third-party services that require some
  # extra JavaScript or CSS. Also, you can use it to add extra meta tags to the
  # HTML. Note that this will only be rendered in public pages, not in the admin
  # section.
  #
  # Before enabling this you should ensure that any tracking that might be done
  # is in accordance with the rules and regulations that apply to your
  # environment and usage scenarios. This feature also comes with the risk
  # that an organization's administrator injects malicious scripts to spy on or
  # take over user accounts.
  #
  config.enable_html_header_snippets = true
----

Then you'll have a new textarea field called "Header snippets" in Administration -> Configuration -> Appearance (URL `/admin/organization/appearance/edit`):

Notice that you can resize this textarea.

== Asset pipeline

You can go to app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.sass on your generated applications. There you can override any class using CSS with SASS.

In https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/master/decidim-core/app/assets/stylesheets/decidim/_variables.scss[decidim-core/app/assets/stylesheets/decidim/_variables.scss] you can find the `variables` that can be overriden in your `sass`.

We use http://sass-lang.com/guide[SASS, with SCSS syntax] as CSS preprocessor.

== Accesibility

To maintain accesibility level, if you add new colors use a http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/[Color contrast checker] (WCAG AA is mandatory, WCAG AAA is recommended)
