  # source_path is not being used here as the entrypoints are declared in config/webpacker/custom.js
  # but, it's important to don't update this source_path. The reason why is because all the files
  # below source_path will be used to calculate the digest  of the compiled assets (in development
  # and test environments). If the path is updated and includes by mistake development_app or
  # decidim_dummy_app, cache will be expired on each test and the test suite will get reallly
  # slow.
