  # SMS gateway configuration
  #

  # An example class would be something like:

  # respond to a signed_pdf method containing the pdf with the signature
  #
  # An example class would be something like:
  #
  # class MyPDFSignatureService
  #   attr_accessor :pdf
  #
  #   def initialize(args = {})
  #     @pdf = args.fetch(:pdf)
