  # Custom HTML Header snippets
  #
  # The most common use is to integrate third-party services that require some
  # extra JavaScript or CSS. Also, you can use it to add extra meta tags to the
  # HTML. Note that this will only be rendered in public pages, not in the admin
  # section.
  #
  # Before enabling this you should ensure that any tracking that might be done
  # is in accordance with the rules and regulations that apply to your
  # environment and usage scenarios. This component also comes with the risk
  # that an organization's administrator injects malicious scripts to spy on or
  # take over user accounts.

  # SMS gateway configuration
  #
  # If you want to verify your users by sending a verification code via
  # SMS you need to provide a SMS gateway service class.
  #
  # An example class would be something like:
  #
  # class MySMSGatewayService
  #   attr_reader :mobile_phone_number, :code
  #
  #   def initialize(mobile_phone_number, code)
  #     @mobile_phone_number = mobile_phone_number

  # Timestamp service configuration
  #
  # Provide a class to generate a timestamp for a document. The instances of
  # this class are initialized with a hash containing the :document key with
  # the document to be timestamped as value. The istances respond to a
  # timestamp public method with the timestamp
  #
  # An example class would be something like:
  #
  # class MyTimestampService
  #   attr_accessor :document
  #
  #   def initialize(args = {})
  #     @document = args.fetch(:document)
  #   end

  #     "My timestamp"

  #
  # config.timestamp_service = "MyTimestampService"

  # PDF signature service configuration
  #
  # Provide a class to process a pdf and return the document including a
  # digital signature. The instances of this class are initialized with a hash
  # containing the :pdf key with the pdf file content as value. The instances
  # respond to a signed_pdf method containing the pdf with the signature
  #
  # An example class would be something like:
  #
  # class MyPDFSignatureService
  #   attr_accessor :pdf
  #
  #   def initialize(args = {})
  #     @pdf = args.fetch(:pdf)
  #   end
  #
  #   def signed_pdf
  #     # Code to return the pdf signed
  #   end
  # end
  #
  # config.pdf_signature_service = "MyPDFSignatureService"

  # Etherpad configuration
  #
  # Only needed if you want to have Etherpad integration with Decidim. See
  # Decidim docs at docs/services/etherpad.md in order to set it up.
  #
  # config.etherpad = {
  #   server: Rails.application.secrets.etherpad[:server],
