# frozen_string_literal: true

# An example authorization handler used so that users can be verified against
# third party systems.
#
# You should probably rename this class and file to match your needs.
#
# If you need a custom form to be rendered, you can create a file matching the
# class name named "_form".
#
# Example:
#
#   A handler named Decidim::CensusHandler would look for its partial in:
#   decidim/census/form
#
# When testing your authorization handler, add this line to be sure it has a
# valid public api:
#
#   it_behaves_like "an authorization handler"
#
# See Decidim::AuthorizationHandler for more documentation.
class DummyAuthorizationHandler < Decidim::AuthorizationHandler
  # Define the attributes you need for this authorization handler. Attributes
  # are defined using Virtus.
  #
  attribute :document_number, String
  attribute :postal_code, String
  attribute :birthday, Decidim::Attributes::LocalizedDate

  # You can (and should) also define validations on each attribute:
  #
  validates :document_number, presence: true

  # You can also define custom validations:
  #
  validate :valid_document_number

  # The only method that needs to be implemented for an authorization handler.
  # Here you can add your business logic to check if the authorization should
  # be created or not, you should return a Boolean value.
  #
  # Note that if you set some validations and overwrite this method, then the
  # validations will not run, so it's easier to remove this method and rewrite
  # your logic using ActiveModel validations.
  #
  # def valid?
  #   raise NotImplementedError
  # end

  # If set, enforces the handler to validate the uniqueness of the field
  #
  def unique_id
    document_number
  end

  # If you need to store any of the defined attributes in the authorization you
  # can do it here.
  #
  # You must return a Hash that will be serialized to the authorization when
  # it's created, and available though authorization.metadata
  #
  def metadata
    super.merge(document_number: document_number, postal_code: postal_code)
