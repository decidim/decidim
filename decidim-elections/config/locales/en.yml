            explanation_callout: A ballot style specifies what questions a voter will be presented in the booth. In a ballot style, you can choose what questions from this voting's election components belong to a ballot. The ballot style code is used to match a voter from the census with the ballot they will be presented in the booth. Do not create any ballot style if you always want to present all the questions.
