Search Engine
=============

API
---

> An API must be defined that can be applied to other Components (and other content, such as users who have decided to make their profile information public).
> The fields that can be indexed in order to perform the search should be indicated.
> This API will have to take into account whether a Component has been published or not.

1. which `Component`s will expose a search API?
  1. which `Field`s of the component are _searchable_?

Searches for different Components
---------------------------------

> Searches for different Components (and other contents) that make up the application can be made,
> as well as the text in documents published on the platform.

1. Search in documents? documents == uploads?
2. what do you mean by other contents?

Results page showed by typology and ordered
-------------------------------------------

> The search results page will show the contents according to typology and order them using a defined priority:
> for example, terms found in Assemblies will be displayed first, followed by Participatory Processes, Results,
> Face-to-face meetings, Proposals, etc.

1. What are the different tipology?
  1. in what order should the tipologies be showed?
  2. Within each typology in which order result items should be displayed


Parameterization
---------------

> The search engine can be parametrised in such a way that, depending on where it is called, it can give different results:
> For example, a user may search from their profile and find information from only the results or contents that they follow,
> or those they have created; or an administrator could search for unpublished content from the admin page

1. What are these parameters?
  1. in what contents are applied?

> The search engine will be integrated into the following sites:
>
> + Home page
> + Participatory spaces:
>   + Assemblies
>   + Processes
> + Initiatives
> + User pages
