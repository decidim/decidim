# Decidim::Assemblies

Assemblies are the permanent Decidim's participatory space. They are always
"active" so unlike participatory processes, they have no steps or phases.

A assembly can get different components (such as meetings or proposals) attached.
It can also have attachments, be associated to custom categories or scopes, and
can be fully managed via an administration UI.

## Usage

This module provides:

* A CRUD engine to manage assemblies.

* Public views for assembly via a high level section in the main menu.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'decidim-assemblies'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle
```
