    # This class handles what events must be triggered, and to what users,
    # after a comment is created. Handles these cases:
    #
    # - A user is mentioned in the comment
    # - My comment is replied
    # - A user I'm following has created a comment/reply
    # - A new comment has been created on a resource, and I should be notified.
    #
    # A given user will only receive one of these notifications, for a given
    # comment. The comment author will never be notified about their own comment.
    # If need be, the code to handle this cases can be swapped easily.
