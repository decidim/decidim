# Loading the autoprefixer for WebKit browsers during tests will cause some
# tests to fail since parts of the UI are rendered differently. This is due to
# WebKit version used in PhantomJS that does not render some of the modern CSS
# features the same way as expected by the Foundation framework. For example,
# some elements are overlapping other elements which causes the elements to be
# inaccessible during the specific tests.
