# The great title for a new law
## A co-creation process to create creative creations
When public administrations will need to create or implement things, open and co-creative processes with the participation of any public or private person or institution will be required.

The following co-creation process will be followed: We all will think think think and create and meditate and think and obtain creations at the end, blah, blah..

## Creative consensus for the Creation
Creations will require a consensus from all the participants. Depending on the Creation to be created the following consensus systems will be used:
- consensus by simple majority: when a, b, and c appear in the creation.
- consensus by enhanced majority: when a, b, c and also d appear in the creation.
- consensus by absolute majority: when x, y and z appear in the creation.
- consensus by imposing whatever the organization wants: to be used at will.
- consensus by ignoring whatever resulted from the previous consensus: to be used when organization don't like the results of another consensus system.

It must be taken into account that using "consensus by ignoring whatever resulted from the previous consensus" will grant participants the right to produce a revolution and annihilate the organization.

# Summary
We use here a main title again for the summary because we don't know what will happen when having many main titles in one document.
