# Decidim::Dev

This module allows local development of decidim's components and other features.

## Usage

`decidim-dev` provides some testing utils such as shared contexts, examples, and
dummy assets or resources that you can use to test your own modules. It also
provides a `decidim:generate_external_test_app` rails task that you can use to
generate a dummy application to test your module.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'decidim-dev'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle
```
