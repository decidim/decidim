              Configuring the CTA through the Phase of the participatory process is deprecated with the new design.
              Now this is done in the <b>Landing Page</b>, using the <b>Hero and image</b> content block.
              We have left it here for you to migrate the CTAs that you need. The fields <i>Call to action path</i> and
              <i>Call to action text</i> will be removed in the next version.
