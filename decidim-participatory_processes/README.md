# Decidim::ParticipatoryProcesses

Participatory processes are the standard Decidim's participatory space.

A participatory process can define its own steps, and attach different components
(such as meetings or proposals) with different configurations to each of them.

A participatory process can have attachments, be associated to custom
categories, and are fully manageable via an administration UI.

## Usage

This module provides:

* A CRUD engine to manage participatory processes.

* Public views for participatory process via a high level section in the main
  menu.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'decidim-participatory_processes'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle
```
