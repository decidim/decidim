            <p>API users allow integration developers to add administrative machine user accounts to the system. These machine users can act as administrators on the platform to perform updates that normal administrators would perform through the administration panel. A typical use case is an external management platform where an automated script would perform administrative tasks with the platform without a real user having to authenticate to the system. For example, an automation system might want to send answers to proposals in which case we need an integration user to perform this task within this platform.</p>
            <p>The main difference between these accounts and normal administrator accounts is that these users are meant to be used by machines and therefore their password requirements are different. These users do not need to regularly update their password and changing the account password can happen in a managed way when needed.</p>
            <p>These credentials are meant to be used by machines. Participant-facing applications should be integrated with <a href="%{oauth_link}">OAuth applications</a>.</p>

            api:read: Allows the user to perform query operations through the GraphQL API.
            api:write: Allows the user to perform mutation operations through the GraphQL API.
            profile: Provides access to the user's own profile details. Only this scope is needed in case the OAuth application is only used as an identity provider or an authentication service.
            user: Ability to act as the signed in user with the given token during calls to the GraphQL API. This is required for all api:write operations or api:read operations that need information about the current user.

            The selected scopes will be available for the connected applications to request during the authorization process. The user will be presented details about the authorization request when they sign in using OAuth.

            Different scopes provide different features for the authenticated user using the granted access tokens.
            <br>
            <strong>Note:</strong> If you only need to authenticate the users to your external applications, you only need the <strong>profile</strong> scope. Applications interacting with the Decidim API require other scopes as well.
