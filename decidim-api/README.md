# Decidim::Api

Exposes a [GraphQL](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/) API to programmatically interact with the Decidim platform via HTTP.

## Usage

Including `decidim-api` will get expose two nice endpoints:

* `/api`: The main GraphQL endpoint that holds the actual API.
* `/api/docs`: Nicely-written docs of the entities of the API.
* `/api/graphiql`: A neat sandbox to interactively play with the API and its capabilities.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'decidim-api'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle
```
