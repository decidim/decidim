# Change Log

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/tree/HEAD)

### Upgrade notes

- **Endorsements**

This new version of Decidim has extracted the Endorsement feature into a generic concern that can now be applied to many resources.
To keep current Decidim::Proposals::Proposal's endorsement information, endorsements are copied into the new `Decidim::Endorsable` tables and counter cache columns. This is done via migrations.

After this, `Decidim::Proposals::ProposalEndorsement` and the corresponding counter cache column in `decidim_proposals_proposal.proposal_endorsements_count` should be removed. To do so, Decidim will provide the corresponding migration in the next release.

## Removed
In order to prevent errors while upgrading multi-servers envirnoments, the fields `assembly_type` and `assembly_type_other` are maintained. Future releases will take care of this.

- **Organization Time Zones**

Now is its possible to configure every organization (tenant) with a different time zone by any admin in the global configuration. We recommend to not define any specific `config.time_zone` in Rails so it uses UTC internally. In any case Rails configuration will be ignored in the context of the controller (users will be using always organization's configured time zone).

To upgrade it is recommended to configured the proper time zone in the admin for the organization and remove any `config.time_zone` personalization in Rails (unless you know what you are doing).

For those who have not changed the Rails `config.time_zone` (thus using UTC globally) but using dates as if they were non-UTC zones might notice that changing the organization time zone will shift all presented dates accordingly. This might require to re-edit any scheduled date in meetings or debates in order be properly displayed.

- **Data portability**

Thanks to [#5342](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/5342), Decidim now supports removal of user's data portability expired files from Amazon S3. Check out the [scheduled tasks in the getting started guide](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md#scheduled-tasks) for information in how to configure it.

- **SSL is forced on by default**
