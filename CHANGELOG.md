These are one time actions that need to be done after the code is updated in the production database.

 with `crontab`, although alternatively you could use `whenever` gem or the scheduled jobs of your hosting provider.

### 5. Changes in APIs

### Added

### Changed

#### Tailwind CSS introduction

Decidim redesign has introduced Tailwind CSS framework to compile CSS. It integrates with Webpacker,
which generates Tailwind configuration dynamically when Webpacker is invoked. More details in the PR [#9480](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/9480/).

You'll need to add `tailwind.config.js` to your app `.gitignore`. If you generate a new Decidim app
from scratch, that entry will already be included in the `.gitignore`.
