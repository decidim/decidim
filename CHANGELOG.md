# Change Log

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/tree/HEAD)

### Upgrade notes

- **Endorsements**

This new version of Decidim has extracted the Endorsement feature into a generic concern that can now be applied to many resources.
To keep current Decidim::Proposals::Proposal's endorsement information, endorsements are copied into the new `Decidim::Endorsable` tables and counter cache columns. This is done via migrations.

After this, `Decidim::Proposals::ProposalEndorsement` and the corresponding counter cache column in `decidim_proposals_proposal.proposal_endorsements_count` should be removed. To do so, Decidim will provide the corresponding migration in the next release.
