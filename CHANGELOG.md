# Change Log

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/tree/HEAD)

### Added

- **decidim-core**: Add support for Visual Code Remote Containers and GitHub Codespaces [\6638](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/6638)

### Changed

- **Comments no longer use react**

As per [\#6498](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/6498), the comments component is no longer implemented with the react component. In case you had customized the react component, it will still work as you would expect as the GraphQL API has not disappeared anywhere. You should, however, gradually migrate to the "new way" (Trailblazer cells) in order to ensure compatibility with future versions too.

### Fixed

### Removed

- **decidim-core**: Remove legacy 'show statistics' checkbox in Appearance. [\#6575](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/6575)
