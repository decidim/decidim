# Change Log

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/tree/HEAD)

## Upgrade Notes

- **decidim-core**: Add support for Visual Code Remote Containers and GitHub Codespaces [\6638](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/6638)

### Changed

- **Bump Ruby to v2.7**

We've bumped the minimum Ruby version to 2.7.1, thanks to 2 PRs:

- [\#6320](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/6320)
- [\#6522](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/6522)

- **Comments no longer use react**

As per [\#6498](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/6498), the comments component is no longer implemented with the react component. In case you had customized the react component, it will still work as you would expect as the GraphQL API has not disappeared anywhere. You should, however, gradually migrate to the "new way" (Trailblazer cells) in order to ensure compatibility with future versions too.

- **Consultations module deprecation**

As the new `Votings` module is being developed and will eventually replace the `Consultations` module, the latter enters the deprecation phase.

### Added

- **decidim-meetings**: Add functionality to enable/disable registration code [\#6698](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/6698)
- **decidim-core**: Adding functionality to report users [\#6696](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/6696)
- **decidim-admin**: Adding possibility of unreporting users [\#6696](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/6696)
- **decidim-core**: Add support for Visual Code Remote Containers and GitHub Codespaces [\6638](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/6638)
