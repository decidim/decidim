#### Social Share Button change

As the gem that we were using for sharing to Social Network don't support Webpacker, we have implemented the same functionality in `decidim-core`.

If you want to have the default social share services enabled (Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram), then you can just remove the initializer in your application:

```console
rm config/initializers/social_share_button.rb
```

If you want to change the default social share services, you'll need to remove this initializer and add it to the Decidim initializer. We recommend doing it with the environment variables and secrets to be consistent with the rest of configurations.

```console
rm config/initializers/social_share_button.rb
```

```ruby
# In config/initializers/decidim.rb
Decidim.configure do |config|
(...)
  config.social_share_services = Rails.application.secrets.decidim[:social_share_services]
end
```

```ruby
# In config/secrets.yml
decidim_default: &decidim_default
(...)
  social_share_services: <%= Decidim::Env.new("DECIDIM_SOCIAL_SHARE_SERVICES", "Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram").to_array.to_json %>
```

And define your own services in the environment variable `DECIDIM_SOCIAL_SHARE_SERVICES` with the services that you want.

With this change you can also define your own services. See [documentation for social share services customization](https://docs.decidim.org/en/customize/social_shares/).
