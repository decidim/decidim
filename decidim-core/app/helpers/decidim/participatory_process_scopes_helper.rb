    # Public: Returns a collection of the given organization scopes, prepending
    # a global scope. The global scope is at the beginning because it's easier
    # to be found there. Use this helper in search forms backed by a
    # `Searchlight::Search` class. The reason is, in the `participatory_process_subscopes`
    # method we use an empty String as the ID for the Global Scope object, which
    # works fine in normal forms, but Searchlight ignores parameters that are empty
    # Arrays, empty Strings, empty Hashes or nil, so if you want to actively filter
    # those elements that do not have a scope, you cannot send an empty String or
    # nil because Searchlight will ignore the parameter. The only solution here is
    # to use a specific String as ID (`"global"`, in our case), and then treat this
    # case in the search class. This is far from ideal, but I don't know a better
    # way to do this.
