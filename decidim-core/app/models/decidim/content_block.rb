    # block images have different uploaders.
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    #     # This will process the image with the uploader defined at the
    #     # manifest, upload it and save the record.
    #     content_block.images_container.my_image = params[:my_image]
    #     content_block.save!
    #
    #     # This is how you can access the image data, just like with any other
    #     # uploader field. You can use the uploader variants too.
    #     content_block.images_container.attached_uploader(:my_image).path
    #     content_block.images_container.attached_uploader(:my_image).path(variant: :big)

    #     # This will delete the attached image

    # block manifest.
