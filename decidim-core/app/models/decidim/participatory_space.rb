module Decidim
  # A ParticipatorySpace resource holds logic related to that space. It's mostly
  # used to handle whether that space should be active and published. Comparing
  # it to the `Component` class, multiple components of the same type can exist
  # per space and per organization, while for `ParticipatorySpace` there can
  # only be one of each kind per organization. This causes all elements of a
  # component to be related to that component (eg all `Proposals` belong to
  # their `component`), while for spaces this is not necessary.
