module Decidim
  # A factory to build forms. This is done to add a context when possible, so
  # that forms can act based on data that varies between requests. This is
  # mostly done so that i18n form fields can be properly validated with the
  # `current_organization` available locales, instead of doing so against all
  # the available locales in the platform. The `current_organization` varies
  # between requests, so the form need some way to access this data.
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #   # in a controller, mostly in a `create` action:
  #   form(MyFormClass).form_params(params)
  #
  #   # in a controller, mostly in a `new` action:
  #   form(MyFormClass).instance
  #
  #   # in a controller, mostly in an `edit` action:
  #   form(MyFormClass).form_model(@my_resource)
  #
