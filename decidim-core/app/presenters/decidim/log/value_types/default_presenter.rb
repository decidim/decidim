      # This class is used as a base for other value presenters,
      # and as a default presenter when the presenter for the
      # given value is not specified or is not found.
      #
      # Value presenters are dynamically found from the value type
      # set in the `fields_mapping` method in the resource presenter.
      # If the value is a symbol, the system will try to infer the
      # correct presenter and use it. If it's a String, it will treat
      # it as a class name, and will try to fetch that presenter.
      # If the system fails in either case, it will use the `DefaultPresenter`.
      #
      # Check the other presenters in this folder for more examples.
