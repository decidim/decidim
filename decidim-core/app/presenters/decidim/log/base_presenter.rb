module Decidim
  module Log
    # This class holds the logic to present a resource for any activity log.
    # It is supposed to be a base class for all other log renderers, as it defines
    # some helpful methods that later presenters can use.
    #
    # Most presenters that inherit from this class will only need to overwrite
    # the `action_string` method, which defines what I18n key will be used for
    # each action. Other methods that might be interesting to overwrite are those
    # named `present_*`. Check the source code and the method docs to see how they
    # work.
    #
    # See `Decidim::ActionLog#render_log` for more info on the log types and
    # presenters.
    #
    # Usage should be automatic and you shouldn't need to call this class
    # directly, but here's an example:
    #
    #    action_log = Decidim::ActionLog.last
    #    view_helpers # => this comes from the views
    #    BasePresenter.new(action_log, view_helpers).present
    class BasePresenter
      # Public: Initializes the presenter.
      #
      # action_log - An instance of Decidim::ActionLog
      # view_helpers - An object holding the view helpers at the render time.
      #   Most probably should come automatically from the views.
      def initialize(action_log, view_helpers)
        @action_log = action_log
        @view_helpers = view_helpers
      end

      # Public: Renders the given `action_log`.
      #
      # action_log - An instance of Decidim::ActionLog.last
      # view_helpers - An object holding the view helpers at the render time.
      #   Most probably should come automatically from the views.
