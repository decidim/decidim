// This is a file that can be overridden by the application in order to override styles
// Notice that this file is included at the very end of the stylesheets packs to have
// more priority
//
// Please note this file is only targeting the end user interface and not the admin interface.
// To override the admin interface styles you will need to create a new file having the following path:
// app/packs/stylesheets/decidim/admin/decidim_application.scss
//
// Additionally, you can override the styles for the system interface by adding the file:
// app/packs/stylesheets/decidim/system/decidim_application.scss
//
// To override the Tailwind CSS configuration you can do so by following the instructions
// available at https://docs.decidim.org/en/develop/customize/styles.html#_tailwind_css
//
// By default this is empty.
