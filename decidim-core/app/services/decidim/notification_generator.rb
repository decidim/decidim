module Decidim
  # This class handles system events affecting resources and generates a
  # notification for each recipient by scheduling a new
  # `Decidim::NotificationGeneratorForRecipientJob` job for each of them. This way
  # we can easily control which jobs fail and retry them, so that we don't have
  # duplicated notifications.

    # event - A String with the name of the event.

    # followers - a collection of Users that receive the notification because
    #   they're following it
    # affected_users - a collection of Users that receive the notification because
    #   they're affected by it
    # extra - a Hash with extra information for the event.
