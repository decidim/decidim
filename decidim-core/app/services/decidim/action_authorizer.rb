    #
    # Broadcasts:
    #   ok           - When everything is OK and the user is correctly authorized.
    #   missing      - When no valid authorization can be found.
    #   expired      - The validity time for the given authorization has run out, and
    #                  needs to be re-validated.
    #   pending      - When an authorization was found, but is not complete (eg. is
    #                  waiting for admin manual confirmation).
    #   invalid      - When an authorization was found, but the value of some of its fields
    #                  is not the expected one (eg. the user is authorized for scope A,
    #                  but this action is only for users in scope B).
    #   incomplete   - An authorization was found, but lacks some required fields. User
    #                  should re-authenticate.
    #
    # Returns nil.
