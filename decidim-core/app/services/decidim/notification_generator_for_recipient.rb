module Decidim
  # This class generates a notification based on the given event, for the given
  # resource/recipient couple. It is intended to be used by the

  # of the event, so that we can easily control which jobs fail.

    # event - A String with the name of the event.
    # event_class - The class that wraps the event, in order to decorate it.
    # resource - an instance of a class implementing the `Decidim::Resource` concern.
    # recipient - the ID of the User that will receive the notification.
    # extra - a Hash with extra information to be included in the notification.
