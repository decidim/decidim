    # Storage asset router provides global access to the asset routes for assets
    # saved through ActiveStorage. This handles the different cases for routing
    # to the remote routes when using an assets CDN or to local routes when
    # using the local disk storage driver.
    #
    # Note that when the assets are stored in a remote storage service, such as
    # Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage or Azure Storage, this generates the asset
    # URL directly to the storage service itself bypassing the Rails server and
    # saving CPU time from serving the asset redirect requests. This causes a
    # significant performance improvement on pages that display a lot of images.
    # It will also produce a less significant performance improvement when using
    # the local disk storage because in this situation, the images are served
    # using one request instead of two when served directly from the storage
    # service rather than through the asset redirect URL.
    #
    # When implementing changes to the logic, please keep the remote storage
    # options and performance implications in mind because the specs for this
    # utility do not cover the remote storage options because the extra
    # configuration needed to test, the service itself needed for testing and
    # the extra dependency overhead for adding these remote storage gems when
    # they are not needed.
