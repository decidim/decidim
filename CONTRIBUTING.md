## How to contribute to Decidim

We're really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us in [Gitter](https://gitter.im/decidim/decidim). We want you working on things you're excited about.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in Decidim**, and instead send us an email to security [at] decidim.org.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Decidim will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in [Metadecidim](https://meta.decidim.barcelona/processes/roadmap) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports, fixes and already discussed features on [Metadecidim](https://meta.decidim.barcelona/processes/roadmap).

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Decidim in [Gitter](https://gitter.im/decidim/decidim).

#### **Do you want to contribute to Decidim documentation?**

* Watch out the [Decidim Documentation repository](https://github.com/decidim/docs.decidim.org) and the [decidim.org](https://github.com/decidim/decidim.org) code website.

#### **Do you want to contribute to Decidim design?**

* Go to the [Decidim design repository](https://github.com/decidim/design) and propose the changes that you want.

#### **Do you want to improve or add a new language for Decidim?**

* Add a new issue asking for adding a user to the Crowdin project ([example issue](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/issues/2073)).
