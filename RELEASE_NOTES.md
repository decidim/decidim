# Release Notes

## 1. Upgrade notes

As usual, we recommend that you have a full backup, of the database, application code and static files.

To update, follow these steps:

### 1.1. Update your Gemfile

```ruby
gem "decidim", github: "decidim/decidim"
gem "decidim-dev", github: "decidim/decidim"
```

### 1.2. Run these commands

```console
bundle update decidim
bin/rails decidim:upgrade
bin/rails db:migrate
```

### 1.3. Follow the steps and commands detailed in these notes

## 2. General notes

## 3. One time actions

These are one time actions that need to be done after the code is updated in the production database.

### 3.1. CarrierWave removal

Back in Decidim 0.25 we have added ActiveStorage (via [\#7902](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/7902)) as main uploader instead of CarrierWave.

We've left some code to ease-up with the migration process during these last versions.

In your application, you need to remove the initializer:

```console
rm config/initializers/carrierwave.rb
```

You can read more about this change on PR [\#12200](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/12200).

### 3.2. Esbuild migration

In order to speed up the asset compilation, we have migrated from babel to esbuild.

There are some small changes that needs to be performed in your application code.

- Replace `babel.config.js`
- Patch `config/webpack/custom.js`

```javascript
// Replace
const TerserPlugin = require("terser-webpack-plugin");

// with
const { EsbuildPlugin } = require("esbuild-loader");
```

and also:

```javascript
// replace
    minimizer: [
      new TerserPlugin({
        parallel: Number.parseInt(process.env.SHAKAPACKER_PARALLEL, 10) || true,
        terserOptions: {
          parse: {
            // Let terser parse ecma 8 code but always output
            // ES5 compliant code for older browsers
            ecma: 8
          },
          compress: {
            ecma: 5,
            warnings: false,
            comparisons: false
          },
          mangle: {safari10: true},
          output: {
            ecma: 5,
            comments: false,
            ascii_only: true
          }
        }
      }),
    ].filter(Boolean)

// With

  minimizer: [
    new EsbuildPlugin({
      target: "es2015",
      css: true
    })
  ]
```

You can read more about this change on PR [\#12238](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/12238).

### 3.3. [[TITLE OF THE ACTION]]

You can read more about this change on PR [\#XXXX](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/XXXX).

## 4. Scheduled tasks

Implementers need to configure these changes it in your scheduler task system in the production server. We give the examples
 with `crontab`, although alternatively you could use `whenever` gem or the scheduled jobs of your hosting provider.

### 4.1. [[TITLE OF THE TASK]]

```bash
4 0 * * * cd /home/user/decidim_application && RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails decidim:TASK
```

You can read more about this change on PR [\#XXXX](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/XXXX).

## 5. Changes in APIs

### 5.1. [[TITLE OF THE CHANGE]]

In order to [[REASONING (e.g. improve the maintenance of the code base)]] we have changed...

If you have used code as such:

```ruby
# Explain the usage of the API as it was in the previous version
result = 1 + 1 if before
```

You need to change it to:

```ruby
# Explain the usage of the API as it is in the new version
result = 1 + 1 if after
```
