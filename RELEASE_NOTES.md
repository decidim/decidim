# Release Notes

## 1. Upgrade notes

As usual, we recommend that you have a full backup, of the database, application code and static files.

To update, follow these steps:

### 1.1. Update your Gemfile

```ruby
gem "decidim", github: "decidim/decidim"
gem "decidim-dev", github: "decidim/decidim"
```

### 1.2. Run these commands

```console
sudo apt install p7zip # or the alternative installation process for your operating system. See "2.1. 7zip dependency introduction"
bundle remove spring spring-watcher-listen
bundle update decidim
bin/rails decidim:upgrade
bin/rails db:migrate
```

### 1.3. Follow the steps and commands detailed in these notes

## 2. General notes

### 2.1. 7zip dependency introduction

We had to migrate from an unmaintained dependency and do a wrapper for the 7zip command line. This means that you need to install 7zip in your system. You can do it by running:

```bash
sudo apt install p7zip
```

This works for Ubuntu Linux, other operating systems would need to do other command/package.

You can read more about this change on PR [#13185](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/13185).

## 3. One time actions

These are one time actions that need to be done after the code is updated in the production database.

### 3.1. Remove spring and spring-watcher-listen from your Gemfile

To simplify the upgrade process, we have decided to add `spring` and `spring-watcher-listener` as hard dependencies of `decidim-dev`.

Before upgrading to this version, make sure you run in your console:

```bash
bundle remove spring spring-watcher-listen
```

You can read more about this change on PR [#13235](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/13235).

### 3.2. [[TITLE OF THE ACTION]]

You can read more about this change on PR [#XXXX](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/XXXX).

## 4. Scheduled tasks

Implementers need to configure these changes it in your scheduler task system in the production server. We give the examples
with `crontab`, although alternatively you could use `whenever` gem or the scheduled jobs of your hosting provider.

### 4.1. [[TITLE OF THE TASK]]

```bash
4 0 * * * cd /home/user/decidim_application && RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails decidim:TASK
```

You can read more about this change on PR [#XXXX](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/XXXX).

## 5. Changes in APIs

### 5.1. [[TITLE OF THE CHANGE]]

In order to [[REASONING (e.g. improve the maintenance of the code base)]] we have changed...

If you have used code as such:

```ruby
# Explain the usage of the API as it was in the previous version
result = 1 + 1 if before
```

You need to change it to:

```ruby
# Explain the usage of the API as it is in the new version
result = 1 + 1 if after
        ```
