## 5. Changes in APIs

### 5.1. Require organization in nicknamize method

In order to avoid potential performance issues, we have changed the `nicknamize` method by requiring the organization as a parameter.

If you have used code as such:

```ruby
# We were including the organization in an optional scope
Decidim::UserBaseEntity.nicknamize(nickname, decidim_organization_id: user.decidim_organization_id)
```

You need to change it, to something like:

```ruby
# Now the organization is the required second parameter of the method
Decidim::UserBaseEntity.nicknamize(nickname, user.decidim_organization_id)
```

You can read more about this change on PR [#14669](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/14669).

### 5.2. [[TITLE OF THE CHANGE]]

In order to [[REASONING (e.g. improve the maintenance of the code base)]] we have changed...

If you have used code as such:

```ruby
# Explain the usage of the API as it was in the previous version
result = 1 + 1 if before
```

You need to change it to:

```ruby
# Explain the usage of the API as it is in the new version
result = 1 + 1 if after
```
