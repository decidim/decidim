# Release Notes

## 1. Upgrade notes

As usual, we recommend that you have a full backup, of the database, application code and static files.

To update, follow these steps:

### 1.1. Update your ruby version

If you're using rbenv, this is done with the following commands:

```console
rbenv install 3.x.x
rbenv local 3.x.x
```

You may need to change your `.ruby-version` file too.

If not, you need to adapt it to your environment, for instance by changing the decidim docker image to use ruby:3.x.x.

### 1.2. Update your Gemfile

```ruby
gem "decidim", github: "decidim/decidim"
gem "decidim-dev", github: "decidim/decidim"
```

### 1.3. Run these commands

```console
bundle update decidim
bin/rails decidim:upgrade
bin/rails db:migrate
```

### 1.4. Follow the steps and commands detailed in these notes

## 2. General notes

## 3. One time actions

These are one time actions that need to be done after the code is updated in the production database.

### 3.1. Change of Valuator for Evaluator

We have updated the terminology of Valuator at a code base level throughout the platform. The role of Valuator is now Evaluator. With this change also affects strings, i18n translations and so on.

Implementors must run the following 3 tasks:

```bash
./bin/rails decidim:upgrade:decidim_update_valuators.rake
```

Updates ther role from Valuator to Evaluator within Decidim

```bash
./bin/rails decidim:upgrade:decidim_action_log_valuation_assignment.rake
```

Updates the resource_type of valuation_assignment within the action log.

```bash
./bin/rails decidim:upgrade:decidim_paper_trail_valuation_assignment.rake
```

This updates the item_type of valuation assignment.

More information about this change can be found on PR [#13684](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/13684).

## 4. Scheduled tasks

Implementers need to configure these changes it in your scheduler task system in the production server. We give the examples
with `crontab`, although alternatively you could use `whenever` gem or the scheduled jobs of your hosting provider.

### 4.1. [[TITLE OF THE TASK]]

```bash
4 0 * * * cd /home/user/decidim_application && RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails decidim:TASK
```

## 5. Changes in APIs

### 5.1. [[TITLE OF THE CHANGE]]

In order to [[REASONING (e.g. improve the maintenance of the code base)]] we have changed...

If you have used code as such:

```ruby
# Explain the usage of the API as it was in the previous version
result = 1 + 1 if before
```

You need to change it to:

```ruby
# Explain the usage of the API as it is in the new version
result = 1 + 1 if after
        ```
