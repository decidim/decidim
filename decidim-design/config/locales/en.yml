          color_contrast_paragraph: When creating user interfaces or modifying the colors, always make sure that you are not breaking accessibility with your changes.

          links_and_buttons_paragraph: The anchor elements (i.e. links) are meant to link to different pages or to anchor positions within the page. If the element is supposed to e.g. open some hidden item on that page, you should use the <button> element instead.
