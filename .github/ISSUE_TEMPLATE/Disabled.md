We've disabled the issue creation on this repository. If you want to add a new issue (to report a bug or a feature request) you can do this through MetaDecidim:

* [Report a bug](https://meta.decidim.org/processes/bug-report)
* [Feature Request](https://meta.decidim.org/processes/roadmap)
* [Support Forum](https://meta.decidim.org/processes/supportforum)

We're doing this because we're trying to eat our own dog food. Once your proposal is collaboratively reviewed and accepted by the Product Comitee, we'll create the new issue on GitHub and notify you through MetaDecidim.

Thanks for contributing to Decidim!
