name: Feature request creation disabled
about: Go to Metadecidim :)

---

We have disabled the feature request's issue creation on this repository. If you want to discuss about a new feature, you can do this through Metadecidim:

* [Feature Request](https://meta.decidim.org/processes/roadmap)

We're doing this because we're trying to eat our own dog food. Once your proposal is collaboratively reviewed and accepted by the Product Comitee, we will create the new issue on GitHub and notify you through Metadecidim.

Thanks for contributing to Decidim!
